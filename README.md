# 01-HW_HTML-CSS-Git_CodeRefactor

## Description

Given a organization's website, the task was to refactor the code to meet general accessibility guidelines.

All images were updated with alt attributes, redundant elements were consolidated in the HTML and CSS, replaced vague div tags with HTML semantics, a title element was added, and the HTML & CSS follow a logical, sequential order.
